<p>DDDD is an online platform that is exploring the methodology behind exhibition and
distribution of artworks in the digital space. Distribution is not limited to buying and selling – it means the whole process that an artwork is exhibited, enjoyed, sold and archived on the internet. The platform comprises Online Exhibition, D Collection, and Text. Through the Online Exhibition we investigate how artworks that are anchored in non-physical ground are displayed and appreciated online. We archive past exhibitions on D Collection and sell the displayed artworks in digital file formats. In the Text we publish essays, reviews, and interviews by art professionals as well as by people working in adjacent sectors.</p>
<p>DDDD’s members include artists, writers, journalists, curators, and graphic designers. We are based in Berlin, Hamburg and Seoul. We did not set out to be a bridge between the
contemporary art scenes of Germany and Korea, or of Europe and Asia. However, due to
the scope of the members’ activities and the network, the platform naturally embraces
Korean audiences creating the potential for possible exchanges between the two cultures.
All of DDDD’s activities will be introduced in both English and Korean. Along with our online exhibitions, we are preparing an offline exhibition sponsored by Arts Council Korea in Seoul in the second half of 2020.</p>
